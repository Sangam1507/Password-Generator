## 🧾 How It Works

- **index.html**:  
  Provides the structure of the app, including inputs for user selections (checkboxes and length), a display box for the password, and buttons for generating and copying.

- **style.css**:  
  Styles the interface using modern, responsive design techniques. Uses flexbox to align elements and custom styles for buttons, inputs, and layout.

- **script.js**:  
  Handles the logic of generating passwords. Based on user-selected criteria, it builds a character pool and randomly selects characters to create a password. Also includes clipboard copy functionality.
